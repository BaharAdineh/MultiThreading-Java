MultiThreading Concepts In Simple Way

Many of today's software use synchronization that speeds up our work.
With the advancement of hardware, synchronization is possible more than before.
Â 
In general, synchronization in the program means that the program consists of two or more parts that run simultaneously and each part of the process executes differently.

When multi-processor sources or resources are shared, such as the CPU, they are called multi-tasking.
Multi threading has expanded the idea of multi-tasking into applications so that you have the ability to divide an operation into one or more separate threads.
Each of these threads can run simultaneously.


A thread in your life cycle has different statuses like:

New: In this situation, Thread begins its life cycle. Until it starts, Thread will remain in that state.

Runnable: After a short time, the thread has just entered into this state. In this situation, thread is running a process.

Waiting: Sometimes a thread waits for another thread to end. In this case, the thread is in the waiting state. After waiting (when the thread is finished) the thread's status goes to Runnable.

Dead: When the process is complete Thread goes to Dead.

Running: Run a thread
