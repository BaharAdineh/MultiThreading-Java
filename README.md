MultiThreading Concepts In Simple Way

Many of today's software use synchronization that speeds up our work.
With the advancement of hardware, synchronization is possible more than before.
Â 
In general, synchronization in the program means that the program consists of two or more parts that run simultaneously and each part of the process executes differently.

When multi-processor sources or resources are shared, such as the CPU, they are called multi-tasking.
Multi threading has expanded the idea of multi-tasking into applications so that you have the ability to divide an operation into one or more separate threads.
Each of these threads can run simultaneously.
